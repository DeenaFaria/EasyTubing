Step-by-step guide to setting up the YouTube Data API and obtaining API credentials:

Create a Google Cloud Project:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one.
Click on the project dropdown at the top left and then click on "New Project".
Follow the prompts to create a new project. Give it a name and organization (if applicable).
Enable the YouTube Data API:

Once your project is created, click on the project name at the top left to return to the dashboard.
In the dashboard, click on "APIs & Services" > "Library" in the left-hand navigation.
Search for "YouTube Data API" and click on it in the results.
Click the "Enable" button to enable the API for your project.
Obtain API Credentials (API Key):

From the "APIs & Services" menu, click on "Credentials".
Click the "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" button and select "API Key".
A popup will appear with your API key. You can restrict its usage to improve security, but for now, you can leave it unrestricted.
Copy the API key and keep it secure.
